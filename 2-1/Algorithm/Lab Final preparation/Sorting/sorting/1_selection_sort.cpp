    Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the

   //and then put it at the beginning of the sorted portion of the array

  let's talk about the time complexity of selection sort:
  - The outer loop runs n-1 times, where n is the number of elements in the array.
  - The inner loop runs n-i times, where i is the current index of the outer loop.
    - Therefore, the total number of comparisons is:
        (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1 = n(n-1)/2  
    - This gives us a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case.
    - The best case is also O(n^2) because we still need to check all elements to ensure they are sorted.
    - The average case is also O(n^2) for the same reason.
    - The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any extra space except for a few variables.
